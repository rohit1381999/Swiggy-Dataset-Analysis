# Swiggy Dataset Analysis
This project involves the analysis of the Swiggy dataset with a focus on data cleaning, preprocessing, and deriving insights. The dataset is subjected to various methods, including handling null values, one-hot encoding, imputation, and scaling, where necessary.

# Dataset Overview
The Swiggy dataset contains information related to [describe the key aspects of the dataset, e.g., orders, customers, items, etc.].

# Project Structure
swiggy_data_analysis.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
cleaned_swiggy_data.csv: The CSV file containing the cleaned and pre-processed data.
Steps Taken:
## 1. Data Cleaning
Performed comprehensive data cleaning, addressing issues such as:

## Handling null values.
Removing duplicates.
Correcting data types.
2. Data Pre-Processing
Utilized various methods for data pre-processing:

## One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
Imputation for missing values.
Scaling of numerical features.
3. Deriving Insights
Derived meaningful insights from the pre-processed data:

## [Provide examples of insights obtained, e.g., popular items, customer preferences, etc.].
4. Saving Cleaned Data
The cleaned and pre-processed data is saved into a CSV file named cleaned_swiggy_data.csv for future analysis and sharing.

# Running the Project
Download the Swiggy dataset and place it in the project directory.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook swiggy_data_analysis.ipynb to execute the data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
The cleaned data will be saved in the cleaned_swiggy_data.csv file.
Feel free to explore and customize the code based on your analysis requirements.
